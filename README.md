## **Fake Store API Project**

This project is a part of the curriculum for teaching API integration to students. The goal of this project is to introduce students to working with APIs by using the Fake Store API. In this project, students will create a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Fake Store API and display information about various products.

Project Overview
The project focuses on the following key aspects:

API Integration: Students will learn how to make HTTP requests using JavaScript to interact with the Fake Store API. They will understand how to fetch data from the API and use it to populate their web application.

HTML and CSS: Students will create a simple and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS. The design should allow users to view product information retrieved from the API.

JavaScript: Students will use JavaScript to fetch data from the Fake Store API and dynamically update the UI with the retrieved information. They will also handle user interactions such as clicks and data display.

Project Setup
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to Project Directory: Move to the project directory using the cd command:

bash
Copy code
cd fake-store-api-project
Open the Code: Use your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to open the project files.

Project Structure
The project's directory structure will look like this:

Copy code
fake-store-api-project/

├── index.html

├── styles.css

├── script.js

└── README.md

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of your web application, including placeholders for displaying product information.
styles.css: This file contains the CSS styles that define the appearance of your web application.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for making API requests and updating the UI.
README.md: The file you're currently reading, which provides an overview of the project.
Usage
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The web page will load and display information about products fetched from the Fake Store API.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will achieve the following learning objectives:

Understand the basics of APIs and how to make HTTP requests.
Gain experience working with JSON data.
Learn to create a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Practice integrating external APIs into web applications.
Enhance problem-solving skills by handling data manipulation and UI updates.
Acknowledgments
This project is based on the Fake Store API, which provides a simulated e-commerce store environment for educational purposes. The API's documentation can be found at: Fake Store API Documentation

Conclusion
Through this project, students will get hands-on experience with API integration, creating web applications, and working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By completing the project, students will be better equipped to understand the fundamentals of APIs and apply their knowledge to more complex projects in the future.
